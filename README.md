# GMS2 Project Cleaner

This application scans and removes all unused ``.yy`` files from projects made with GameMaker Studio 2.

Always make a backup of your project before using it.

## Usage

- Tested with runtime *v23.1.1.230*.

1. Make sure that **sandbox** is disabled on your IDE.
2. Copy and paste this [script](https://github.com/ninstar/GMS2-Project-Cleaner/blob/main/Script.gml) in the creation code.
3. Run the compiler.
4. Select the ``.yyp`` file of the project you want to scan.
	+ If it is the same one you are using to run this script, I recommend that you run this script using another project.
6. Wait until the process is finished, a log file will be generated.

> Alternatively, you can use [this](https://github.com/ninstar/GMS2-Project-Cleaner/releases/download/0.1/Cleaner.zip) compiled application.
